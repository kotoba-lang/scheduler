(ns kotoba.lang.scheduler
  "Durable tick scheduler for the kotoba-lang stdlib. A real consumer of the
  sibling libs: kotoba.lang.async (bounded ready-queue), kotoba.lang.time
  (clock + instant/duration), kotoba.lang.coll (job shaping).

  Models a tick loop as a pure state machine: the host advances `now` via an
  injected `clock` (time); `tick` fires the jobs due at `now` (found via the
  job table) and, as it fires each one, puts it onto an `async` bounded
  ready-queue so a host can `kotoba.lang.async/take`/`drain` the queue to
  observe which jobs actually fired; `coll` shapes the job table. The host
  drives the loop; the scheduler is a pure transition — same shape as
  langgraph interrupts and the durable outer loop (lease/tick/budget) in
  CLAUDE.md. No threads, no wall-clock inside the lib.

  Zero third-party runtime deps; .cljc (JVM / SCI / CLJS / GraalVM / kotoba-WASM)."

  Each due job is also put onto :ready-queue (an async bounded channel) as
  `{:id :at :fired-at}`, in fire order, via `kotoba.lang.async/put` — a host
  can `a/take`/`a/drain` the queue to observe which jobs actually fired at
  this or a prior tick, the library's documented async-consumer contract.
  Previously `at`/`every` put the raw job onto :ready-queue at SCHEDULE time
  (before it was ever due), so the queue accumulated schedule-time noise a
  bounded :dropping channel would silently truncate, and nothing in this
  namespace ever drained it — a confirmed dead/lossy write path, now wired
